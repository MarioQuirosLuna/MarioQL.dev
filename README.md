## About

I really liked this project. Since I learned a lot about React while developing it, looking to implement best practices, clean and orderly code. In this project use react-router for navigation, also practice the use of Hooks and Context, to the styles use styled-component in which it use global styles which are repeat in different places and also use ThemeProvider to handle the theme of my application.
